# CODEOWNERS

# This file defines individuals or teams responsible for reviewing
# changes to specific parts of the repository.  GitHub uses these
# patterns to automatically request reviews when a pull request
# touches the listed paths.  Adjust the owners as appropriate for
# your organisation.  Use GitHub handles or team names (e.g.
# @org/team).
