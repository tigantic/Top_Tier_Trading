"""
Workers package for the crypto trading platform.

This package contains longâ€‘running services responsible for ingesting market data,
running trading strategies, enforcing risk limits, executing orders, managing
portfolios, and collecting telemetry.  Each module exposes an asynchronous
`start()` function that is invoked by the central worker manager in
`worker_main.py`.
