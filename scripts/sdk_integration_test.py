"""SDK Integration Test Harness (Offline Stub).

This script demonstrates how to initialise and run the Coinbase SDK
wrappers provided in :mod:`workers.src.workers.clients.sdk_market_data`
and :mod:`workers.src.workers.clients.sdk_user_channel`.  In an
offline development environment where the official SDK cannot be
installed or network access is unavailable, the wrappers will
yield no data.  Nevertheless, this harness shows how to wire them
together and provides clear guidance on replacing the stubbed
implementations with real SDK calls once deployed in a live
environment.

Usage
-----

Run the script directly to start streaming market data and user
events.  The harness reads API credentials and configuration from
environment variables:

``COINBASE_API_KEY``
    Your Coinbase Advanced Trade API key.

``COINBASE_API_SECRET``
    Your Coinbase Advanced Trade API secret.

``COINBASE_PASSPHRASE``
    (Optional) Passphrase for API key if required.

``ALLOWED_MARKETS``
    Commaâ€‘separated list of product IDs to subscribe to (e.g. ``BTC-USD,ETH-USD``).

``USE_STATIC_SANDBOX``
    Set to ``true`` to use the sandbox endpoints.  Defaults to ``true`` in this
    offline harness.

Notes
-----

* In offline mode the SDK wrappers will log a warning and
  yield no events.  This harness still consumes those events and
  prints them for demonstration purposes.
* To integrate with the real Coinbase SDK, ensure the
  ``coinbase-advanced-py`` (or equivalent) package is installed and
  network access is permitted.  Replace the placeholder code in
  ``sdk_market_data.py`` and ``sdk_user_channel.py`` with real SDK
  calls.  Then this harness will stream live market data and user
  account updates.
