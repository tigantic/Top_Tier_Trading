"""Verify exportable artifacts.

This script checks that the exportable artifacts (ZIP archive and
merged code file) exist in ``artifacts/exports``, computes their
SHA256 checksums and sizes, and prints them.  It returns a non-zero
exit code if any expected file is missing.

Usage::

    python scripts/verify_exportables.py

This tool can be invoked in CI after building exportables to ensure
provenance.  It does not compare against predetermined values;
instead, it reports the current checksums and sizes for manual
verification.
